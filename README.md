# ðŸ’¤ My LazyVim Configuration

This is my way of using [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), I use [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) as a starter.

## Requirements

- GUI Terminal, I use [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2) but might migrate to [WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)
- [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) installed, `brew install lazygit`
- [Nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) installed, I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/FiraCode.zip)
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) needs [FD](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) and [RipGrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) installed, both can be installed by `brew`
